# Organ-Donation-Management-System
The Organ Donation management System is to create an interface
about the donor that is related to donating the organs. Through this
interface, any person who is interested in donating organs can register
himself. Moreover, if any general consumer wants to request blood
online he can also take the help of this site.
Organ Wastage is a major issue that can only be solved by having a
proper database of all patients and Donors in a well-formed way that
can be processed easily.
Our aim is to create a solution that effectively deals with the problems
of finding donors and also provides Statistical data of the transplants.
